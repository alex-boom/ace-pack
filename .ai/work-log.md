# Work Log

- Initialized ACE in the repository using the local installer with `--apply`.
- Confirmed generated memory files and root agent instruction files were created.
- Verified `npm run ace:check`, `npm run ace:classify`, and Vitest on an active
  Node version that satisfies `>=20`.
- Fixed and covered report decision extraction after ACE setup exposed the issue.
- Added project-specific command notes so future agents use `npm run ace:*`
  when `pnpm` is unavailable.
- Made XML report generation non-blocking when `pnpm.cmd` is unavailable.

- Added first-block meta-architecture warnings to local agent instruction files.
- Documented ACE product files vs repo-local dogfooding files for fork maintainers.
- Added npm payload guard to prevent `.ai/**`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and
  other repo-local files from entering the package tarball.
- Recorded semver policy for shipped package changes vs repo-local dogfooding changes.
- Corrected report decision extraction so brief/full reports surface the newest
  durable decision, including the versioning policy.

- Replaced generic npm keywords with targeted AgentOps, context-management,
  guardrails, cursor-rules, and AI-coding terms.
- Bumped package metadata version from `0.1.3` to `0.1.4` for this publishable
  metadata release.

## 2026-06-13 21:42

- Removed local Node executable/version hardcoding from repo-local ACE
  instructions and memory.
- Kept the public package requirement as generic `node >=20`, so maintainers can
  switch with nvm and use any compatible Node version.
