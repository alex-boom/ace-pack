# Work Log

## 2026-06-13 20:59

- Initialized ACE in the repository using the local installer with `--apply`.
- Confirmed generated memory files and root agent instruction files were created.
- Verified `npm run ace:check`, `npm run ace:classify`, and Vitest on an active
  Node version that satisfies `>=20`.
- Fixed and covered report decision extraction after ACE setup exposed the issue.
- Added project-specific command notes so future agents use `npm run ace:*`
  when `pnpm` is unavailable.
- Made XML report generation non-blocking when `pnpm.cmd` is unavailable.

## 2026-06-13 21:19

- Added first-block meta-architecture warnings to local agent instruction files.
- Documented ACE product files vs repo-local dogfooding files for fork maintainers.
- Added npm payload guard to prevent `.ai/**`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and
  other repo-local files from entering the package tarball.
- Recorded semver policy for shipped package changes vs repo-local dogfooding changes.
- Corrected report decision extraction so brief/full reports surface the newest
  durable decision, including the versioning policy.

## 2026-06-13 21:35

- Replaced generic npm keywords with targeted AgentOps, context-management,
  guardrails, cursor-rules, and AI-coding terms.
- Bumped package metadata version from `0.1.3` to `0.1.4` for this publishable
  metadata release.

## 2026-06-13 21:42

- Removed local Node executable/version hardcoding from repo-local ACE
  instructions and memory.
- Kept the public package requirement as generic `node >=20`, so maintainers can
  switch with nvm and use any compatible Node version.

## 2026-06-13 22:25

- Fixed `tools/check-npm-payload.mjs` so Windows/Git Bash release checks no
  longer fail with `spawn EINVAL` when npm dry-run inspection is executed.
- Added `publish:npm:dry` and made `release:npm:dry` run payload guard,
  pack dry-run, and publish dry-run.
- Switched repo development/link commands and local helper scripts to npm/npm.cmd.
- Added VS Code tasks that explicitly call `npm.cmd` for clean Windows task runs.
- Verified `npm.cmd run release:npm:dry`, `npm.cmd run publish:npm:dry`,
  `.local/publish-npm.cmd`, Git Bash `pnpm run release:npm:dry`, `npm.cmd run test`,
  and `npm.cmd run ace:check`.

## 2026-06-13 22:28

- Added `vibe-coding` to npm keywords and bumped package version to `0.1.5`.
- Added subtle vibe coding positioning to both GitHub and npm README surfaces.
- Kept the change metadata/docs-only with no CLI, template, or runtime behavior changes.
- Verified JSON metadata, npm payload guard, full dry npm release, staged npm
  README content, Vitest, and ACE memory check.

## 2026-06-13 23:05

- Added GitHub-only `ROADMAP.md` with ACE vision, product promise, anti-goals,
  release roadmap, v2.0+ research seeds, and explicit AI opt-in policy.
- Updated `DEVELOPING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, README, and `.ai/product-roadmap.md`
  to align future product work with zero-bloat and privacy-safe defaults.
- Added `ROADMAP.md` to the npm payload guard's forbidden paths so strategy docs
  stay out of the package tarball.
- Added a required task handoff rule: future agents must explicitly report
  whether npm publish is required, using staged npm payload impact as the
  decision boundary.

## 2026-06-14 00:29

- Refreshed package metadata and README positioning around zero-dependency
  local AgentOps for AI coding agents.
- Bumped package version to `0.1.6` because `package.json` and
  `README.npm.md` are shipped npm payload files.
- Added Cursor, Claude Code, Aider, GitHub Copilot, and ChatGPT discovery
  keywords while keeping product behavior unchanged.
- Verified `ace:check`, npm payload guard, npm pack preview, and npm publish
  dry-run.

## 2026-06-14 01:15

- Bumped package version to `0.1.7` for shipped report and hub improvements.
- Added `## Start Snapshot` to brief/full reports with local git state, task
  lifecycle, first-backtick next command, release decision, and stack fallback.
- Updated `ace:hub` option 1 so new AI coder context starts with
  `.ai/report-brief.md` when available and still works before first report
  generation.
- Verified Vitest, ACE memory check, npm payload guard, and full npm release
  dry-run for `ace-pack@0.1.7`.

## 2026-06-14 01:26

- Added template-only closeout priority ladder guidance to installed AGENTS,
  CLAUDE, current-task, and handoff templates.
- Kept `ace:finish` logic unchanged so the improvement remains guidance, not a
  new validation burden.
- Confirmed npm latest is still `0.1.6`, so the change remains part of the
  pending `0.1.7` release.
- Verified Vitest after the template test updates.

## 2026-06-14 10:46

- Confirmed `ace-pack@0.1.7` is published on npm.
- Updated repo-local ACE handoff/current-task state so future sessions do not
  keep recommending another `0.1.7` publish.

## 2026-06-14 10:59

- Implemented v0.2 onboarding scanner expansion and bumped package version to
  `0.2.0`.
- Added richer JS/TS, Python, Go, Rust, and generic monorepo detection while
  keeping rules conservative and dependency-free.
- Added `## Why Detected` project-profile output plus concise CLI summary lines
  for the first-run “aha” moment.
- Verified Vitest, ACE memory check, npm payload guard, and full npm release
  dry-run for `ace-pack@0.2.0`.

## 2026-06-14 11:13

- Implemented v0.3 ACE Hub Primary UX and bumped package version to `0.3.0`.
- Added named hub modes, direct mode selection, stdout/custom-output/JSON
  output controls, metadata headers, and PR git summary context.
- Kept numeric options compatible and avoided new dependencies, schemas,
  clipboard automation, MCP, CI gates, network calls, or AI calls.
- Verified Vitest, ACE memory check, npm payload guard, and full npm release
  dry-run for `ace-pack@0.3.0`.
