# Decisions

## 2026-06-13 20:59

Decision:
- Initialize this repository with its own local ACE installer instead of
  hand-writing the memory scaffold.

Reason:
- The repository should validate the same init path that package consumers use,
  and future chats need project state stored in files rather than conversation
  history.

Impact:
- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.ai/*`, and additive `ace:*` package scripts are
  now part of the project workflow.

## 2026-06-13 21:19

Decision:
- Keep the ACE product layer and repo-local ACE dogfooding layer explicitly
  labeled in committed documentation and agent instruction files.

Reason:
- This repository builds ACE while also using ACE locally, so fork maintainers
  and AI agents need a first-context warning that global product behavior lives
  in `scripts/*`, not local `.ai/**` state.

Impact:
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` start with a meta-architecture warning.
- `DEVELOPING.md` and `.ai/README.md` document file ownership boundaries.
- `npm run check:npm-payload` protects the published package from local AI
  history, reports, and archive snapshots.

## 2026-06-13 21:19

Decision:
- Require a semver bump before publishing shipped package changes, but do not
  require a bump for repo-local dogfooding-only files excluded from npm.

Reason:
- npm rejects republishing the same version, and consumers need version changes
  to discover package updates. Pure `.ai/**`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and
  `DEVELOPING.md` changes do not ship in the npm payload, so bumping for those
  alone creates noisy releases.

Impact:
- Future agents should check whether a change affects the npm payload or
  user-visible ACE behavior before publishing.
- Use patch for fixes/docs/packaging, minor for backward-compatible features,
  and major for breaking CLI/template/workflow changes.
