# Reflection Log

Use this file for short, actionable agent-process reflections. Do not log every
minor task; record repeated tool friction, unclear prompts, poor assumptions,
or workflow improvements worth carrying into future sessions.

## Unresolved

### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm] [Short issue title]
Status: unresolved
- Stuck Point: [Where the agent got stuck]
- Likely Cause: [Tooling, prompt, missing context, or process issue]
- Proposed Improvement: [Concrete change to try next time]

## Resolved

### 2026-06-14 15:46 Schema v2 needs a mirror layer before file moves
Status: resolved
- Stuck Point: Reorganizing `.ai/**` by category can desynchronize older agents,
  tests, and local memory if files are moved without a compatibility layer.
- Likely Cause: Markdown memory is both product data and agent operating
  context, so path cleanup has to preserve human and agent habits.
- Proposed Improvement: Add shared canonical/legacy path helpers first, read
  both paths, write mirrors, and require old-repo fixture tests before future
  schema migrations.

### 2026-06-14 14:34 External agent feedback exposed daily DevEx friction
Status: resolved
- Stuck Point: After v1.0.1 adoption hardening, fast low-risk edits still paid
  too much closeout ceremony and IDE-native agents had no automatic bridge into
  ACE rules.
- Likely Cause: v1.0 focused on stability and rollout documentation, leaving
  daily-loop polish as planned but not shipped behavior.
- Proposed Improvement: Ship v1.1 with small low-risk auto-closeout,
  finish/gate consistency, optional IDE rule bridges, slim planning context,
  and warning-only freshness hints.

### 2026-06-14 13:37 Stability docs before migration machinery
Status: resolved
- Stuck Point: A v1.0 stability milestone can tempt agents to build a migration
  framework before ACE has a concrete breaking schema change.
- Likely Cause: "Stable schema" sounds like an engine requirement, but the
  current product already has a lightweight compatibility contract.
- Proposed Improvement: Document and test the existing contract first; add a
  deterministic migrator only when a future schema version actually needs it.

### 2026-06-14 13:17 Growth assets must not become runtime bloat
Status: resolved
- Stuck Point: Product launch material can accidentally creep into package
  payload or runtime behavior.
- Likely Cause: Demo scripts and fixtures are useful for adoption but not needed
  by installed consumer repositories.
- Proposed Improvement: Keep growth assets GitHub-only, link to them from the
  npm README, and enforce the payload boundary in tests and payload guard.

### 2026-06-14 12:56 MCP stdio must stay dependency-light
Status: resolved
- Stuck Point: Adding MCP support can easily pull SDK dependencies or wrapper
  command output into the core package.
- Likely Cause: MCP examples often use SDKs, while stdio JSON-RPC requires
  stdout framing that npm lifecycle output can corrupt.
- Proposed Improvement: Keep ACE MCP as a direct `node` stdio resource adapter
  with Node built-ins only, and consider a separate optional package only if
  future MCP features truly require dependencies.

### 2026-06-14 12:22 Strict gates can hurt adoption
Status: resolved
- Stuck Point: A quality gate that blocks small human edits may train users to
  bypass or remove ACE entirely.
- Likely Cause: Standard task closeout expectations were being reused directly
  inside PR/CI gate behavior.
- Proposed Improvement: Keep `ace:finish` disciplined, but make `ace:gate`
  stricter only for large or high-risk changes and require an explicit reason
  for human overrides.

### 2026-06-14 11:56 Release readiness needs install-level smoke
Status: resolved
- Stuck Point: Unit tests and dry-run publish can pass while installed ACE
  behavior in a fresh repository or dogfooding sync still has regressions.
- Likely Cause: Packaging and self-apply paths cross repository boundaries that
  source-only tests do not fully exercise.
- Proposed Improvement: Run fake-project smoke from the local staged package and
  use explicit dogfood self-check before final release, never as hidden publish
  automation.

### 2026-06-14 11:40 CI gates need actionable failures
Status: resolved
- Stuck Point: A failing PR gate is only useful if the developer can fix it
  from plain CI logs.
- Likely Cause: Generic gate failures hide which ACE memory section needs
  attention.
- Proposed Improvement: Keep gate failures file-specific and include the exact
  next fix, while reusing existing ACE validation logic.

### 2026-06-14 10:59 First-run onboarding needs terminal feedback
Status: resolved
- Stuck Point: A useful `.ai/project-profile.md` can still hide the onboarding
  “aha” moment if the terminal only says to open another file.
- Likely Cause: Early onboarding output focused on generated artifacts rather
  than the detected project shape.
- Proposed Improvement: Keep the scanner deterministic, but print a concise CLI
  summary of detected ecosystems and project-specific risk rules.

### 2026-06-14 01:26 Flat closeout checklists invite overwork
Status: resolved
- Stuck Point: Agents can treat every ACE closeout instruction as equally
  mandatory and spend effort on docs or ceremony that does not reduce risk.
- Likely Cause: The default completion checklist and end-of-task instructions
  were presented as a flat list instead of a priority ladder.
- Proposed Improvement: Keep closeout guidance template-only and instruct
  agents to do the smallest closeout that preserves future context and safety.

### 2026-06-14 01:15 New chats need an operational start snapshot
Status: resolved
- Stuck Point: A new AI chat had to read several `.ai/*` files and run git
  commands to answer simple "where are we?" questions.
- Likely Cause: The brief report summarized task memory but did not surface
  repo state, next command, or publish decision as a first-class startup block.
- Proposed Improvement: Generate `## Start Snapshot` in brief/full reports and
  put `.ai/report-brief.md` first in AI Coder hub context.

### 2026-06-13 20:59 Persist release process outside chat
Status: resolved
- Stuck Point: npm publishing details and README/logo split can be forgotten in
  a new chat.
- Likely Cause: Release steps were previously only discussed in conversation.
- Proposed Improvement: Keep publish commands discoverable through
  `package.json` scripts and record npm publishing notes in `.ai/session-handoff.md`.
